### What is it?

An ambidextrous organization is like a person who can use both hands equally well. It can balance two important things:

- Stability: being efficient, reliable, and consistent in delivering products or services that customers love
- Innovation: constantly coming up with new ideas, exploring new opportunities, and being creative in solving problems

---

### What is it?

An ambidextrous organization is one that pursues a growth ambition by separating the people responsible for operating a core business from those that explore into new market areas.

---

### Juggling two priorities

- Many companies focus too much on stability, becoming too rigid and slow
- Other companies focus too much on innovation, becoming too chaotic and unreliable

The ambidextrous organization - balance between these two priorities.
