This is a repository of Usevalad Prudnikau.

I am going to use ~~Python~~ Markdown in this class. **Markdown** is great!

This class is at [CBS](https://cbs.de).

We are going to learn:

- How digital organization work.
- What modern types of organizational exist.
- Present in the browser.

We are pretending we are developers, because:

1. we use the CLI
1. we learn about the GitHub workflow.
1. we will make a presentation in the browser.
1. we are cool and make only hand-written graphs that we have developed ourselves.
